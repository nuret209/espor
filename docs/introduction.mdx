# Introduction
<DashedLine></DashedLine>
Skip the months of implementation - we've turned the entire AlignUI design system into production-ready code blocks you can drop into your project. Get pixel-perfect, accessible components without sacrificing customization or control.
## Why Copy/Paste?
Instead of distributing our components as an npm package, we provide the source code directly to your project. This gives you:

* Complete control over the implementation
* Freedom to customize and extend components
* No dependency lock-in
* Direct access to modify styles and behavior

## Built for Production

Each component is built on proven foundations:

Core behaviors powered by Radix UI
Styling through Tailwind CSS
TypeScript for type safety
Accessibility built-in
